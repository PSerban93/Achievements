The Save Path is where the AppID folder is created and stored.
- Notification Preset and Position can be set on different main screen position.
- Sounds cand be changed and Language also based on achievements.json generated from steam if other languages exist on the file.
- After the config is saved, can be loaded from the dropdown, and the app will:
populate the tabel on the main window with all the achievements title\description and images,
populate the overlay window [Shift+O] with all the achievements title\description and images,
start looking for Save Path\AppID\achievements.json, when is created it will read it and if the achievement is unlocked will read the title\description from config json and send the notification.
Games need to be in Borderless, on Fullscreen not all of them are working.
If the game already has achievement unlocked, when it first load, it will displayed all the achievements unlocked and store them to not be displayed next time.
